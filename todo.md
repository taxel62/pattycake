# TODO
- Implement methods that add tile genes and glue genes to the organism.
	- Be sure to add constraints for adding the genes. For example, we don't want redefinitions of glues, we don't want to add tiles if we are already at a max, etc.
- Implement the general algorithm evolving the organisms.
- Easier way to create seed assembly.
